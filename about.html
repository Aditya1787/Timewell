        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>TimeWell was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful mission: to help people take control of their time and live more productive, fulfilling lives. Our founders, a group of productivity enthusiasts and tech innovators, noticed a common problem—people were overwhelmed by their daily tasks, struggling to balance work, personal goals, and life’s many demands. They set out to create a solution that would simplify task management, goal setting, and time tracking, all in one intuitive platform.</p>
        <p>From a small startup in San Francisco, TimeWell has grown into a global platform, serving over 50,000 users across 100+ countries. We’ve helped professionals, students, entrepreneurs, and families organize their lives, achieve their dreams, and find more time for what truly matters. Our journey is just beginning, and we’re committed to continuously improving our tools to meet the evolving needs of our community.</p>
